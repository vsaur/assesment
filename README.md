Landing Page Project README
Project Description
This is a simple landing page project for the company Tekdi Technologies. The landing page showcases the company's services, success stories, and other relevant information.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the landing page.
landing.css: The CSS file containing the styling for the landing page.
images/: A folder containing all the image assets used in the landing page.
Getting Started
To view the landing page, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Styling and Layout
The landing page uses CSS to style various components, including the navigation bar, content sections, success story boxes, and sponsor logos.

The background of the body is set to a white JPEG image (images/white.jpeg).
The navigation bar (nav-bar) is fixed at the top of the page and contains links to different sections of the landing page.
The content sections use different background images and colors to create visual separation.
The success story boxes (box-content) have a blue background color and a blur effect when hovered over.
The sponsor logos (sponser-logo) are displayed horizontally and have a grayscale filter that changes to color when hovered over.
Responsiveness
The landing page is designed to be responsive, adjusting its layout and styling based on different screen sizes and devices.
